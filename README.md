💬 Answers to frequently asked questions 💬

1️⃣ Why do you sell software and not earn money yourself?

🔵I personally have been using the software for 1 years . But since my income has not fallen during this time, and the wallets that exist in the world amount to billions and there are even more of them, I decided to earn even more and sell software subscriptions, this in no way affects my income from software, but this also brings additional profit.

2️⃣ Money out of thin air?

🔵At the moment it may seem so, but a tremendous amount of work has been done to make this software work the way I like it. So this is the hardest easy money for me.

3️⃣ What are the guarantees?

🔵I understand that the world is full of offers and promises, but let's talk about reality. I'm not promising you instant success or millions overnight. However, what I guarantee you is that if you don't see results in a 2 week, I will give you your money back!

4️⃣ It is legal?

🔵Most of the wallets found are forgotten crypto wallets.
I compare it to searching for gold jewelry on the seashore, when people with a device walk around looking for lost rings, earrings, etc., no one can say that this is illegal. I think it's the same here!

5️⃣ Give me the program, I will pay you a percentage of the profit.

🔵I have no way to see how much the program found for you. I'm here to sell a monthly subscription to software, and not to keep track of who paid me % and who didn't.

6️⃣ Can the program stop working?

🔵We have 1 years of stable work behind us. The program will stop working only if Bitcoin costs $1. I think everyone understands that this will not happen in the next don't know how many years.

7️⃣ How much will I earn per day?
 
🔵It all depends on luck and resources  you have ! . But I cannot predict the amount of money in these wallets. But if you look at distances of 1 years,then the full version earns a lot . There are also very large finds.
